# Darknet

I've been fixated on how to make something like the darknet from Daemon (better reference for book here).

The key attributes of the darknet was it was distributed in execution, control and storage.  This distribution was redundant so the termination of any one node would not stop the darknet.  It was also encrypted and meshed (is that a term?).

To achieve some of these attributes, I'm looking to combine a few of my favorite technologies.

1. CJDNS (link)
2. IPFS (link)
3. tuple-space parallel programs. (link)

CJDNS is already a huge meshnetwork with privacy in mind.  It allows computers to communicate in privacy over a resilliant mesh network and is most importantly agnostic to how the links are made.  The deveopment network, Hyperboria, is mostly over Internet tunnels, but is easily made with physical/wireless adhoc etc.
